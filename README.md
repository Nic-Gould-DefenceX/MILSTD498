# Request For Quotation phase
* [OCD - Operational Concept Description](./DIDS/OCD.html). This describes what the project is about, what is wrong with the current situation, how will the system improve it. 
* [SDP - Software Development Plan](./DIDS/SDP.html). It describes the very basics of how the development will happen: languages, tools, source control, trouble ticketing, change management, testing, validation, phases, timetable, etc. It's best used as a checklist of things that should go into a contract.
* [STP - Software Test Plan](./DIDS/STP.html). It describes in general how and where the testing (especially the acceptance testing) will happen, without going into details on individual tests.

# System design phase 
Requirements Gathering Templates - as required.
* [SSS - System/Subsystem Specification](./DIDS/SSS.html) 
* [SRS Software Requirement Specification](./DIDS/SRS.html) 
* [IRS - Interface Requirement Specification](./DIDS/IRS.html). Only needed if the system will connect to one or more external systems. Best used as a checklist of what to collect from (usually) third parties.
